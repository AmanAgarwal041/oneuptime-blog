### Writing a blog post

If you are interested in writing a blog post, please follow these instructions:

**Step 1**: Fork this repository

**Step 2**: Create a new file in the `posts` directory with the following format:

```
posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-the-post/README.md
```

Please make sure to replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the date of the post and `title-of-the-post` with the title of the post. `title-of-the-post` should be in kebab case.

**Step 3**: Add the following front matter to the top of the file:

```markdown
# Title of the post

Author: [githubusername](https://www.github.com/githubusername)

Tags: Tag1, Tag2, Tag3

Description: One liner description of the post

Rest of your post in markdown format goes here. 
```

**Step 4**: Please add tags to Tags.md

Please make sure to add the tags to the `Tags.md` file in the root of the repository. This will help us categorize the posts.

**Step 5**: Please add your post to Blogs.json. This file is in the root of the repo. Here is an example.  

```json
{
    "title": "Why we dont like TDD: A Developerâ€™s Perspective",
    "description": "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software practice emphasizing writing tests before code. Many find drawbacks in committing to an API prematurely and hindering exploration during early development. ",
    "authorGitHubUsername": "devneelpatel",
    "tags": ["Tests"],
    "post": "2023-11-21-why-we-dont-like-tdd"
}
```

**Step 6**: Create and add a social media image and place it under the `posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-the-post` directory. The image should be named `social-media.png` and should be 1280x720 pixels. This image will be used when sharing the post on social media like Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.

**Step 7**: Create a new branch and submit a pull request

**Step 8**: Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged and your blog post will be live on the OneUptime blog.
